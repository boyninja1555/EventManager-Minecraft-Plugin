# EventManager-Minecraft-Plugin
EventManage is a PaperMC plugin designed to simplify event management on your Minecraft server. With a robust command system, administrators can easily configure events using the `/eventmanage` command (with sub-commands like `details`, `start`, `stop`, and `edit`), while players can join events with the `/joinevent` command.
